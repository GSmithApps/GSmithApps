# Role Type

I'd like to work as a developer advocate, or something
related. 

I know that I like to present and teach, and the evidence I see
shows that my students and audience think I'm effective at that.
As mentioned in the resume, my students all give me very good
ratings, and at the career fair, I made enough impact that the
students were looking for me the following year.
And I have presented at various meetups and enjoyed it and
got a lot of positive feedback from the other members in the
groups.

I also love math, science, and programming. I have experience
and education in these areas, and I also simply have a passion
for them. 

# Full Time Vs Contract

All of my roles so far have been full time, and I think
I want to try contract. I'm still open to both, but contract
work seems like it might be worth a try because I like to
try new things and experience different positions.

# Industry

My instinct is that the industry matters less to me than
the role/position, but there are some industries that would
interest me. In particular, I care a lot about things such as

- education
- technology
- AI and large language models
- personal development
- clear thinking
- mental health

So, if I could work on something in one of those areas or
something related, that would be a plus for me.

# AI

One other thing to mention is that I'm very interested in AI
and large language models. I want to use them in my work,
and I am on board with how helpful they can be. I personally
use things like ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot in my work.


# My Approach

One thing I do is approach work like a programmer.
For example, I like to use git, code, and markdown.

I also like to record things so other people can
use them in the future. For example, instead of
sending an email or taking my own notes, I try
to put them in some documentation so other people
can use them.  Continuing on this, I am an avid
documenter and note taker, and my coworkers
recognize and value it.

I am passionate about innovation. I'm always trying
to use the best technologies I can find, and I'm
always wanting to learn. I use ChatGPT and CoPilot
extensively in my programming.
