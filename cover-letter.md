# Role Type

I'd like to work as a developer advocate, content creator, 
instructor, programmer, or something related. 

What I know about myself is
that I am passionate about making things crystal clear, and
to me, some great ways to do that are teaching, presenting, 
writing, explaining, or writing code.  In addition
to making things crystal clear, compassion toward
the people in the audience is very important to me,
so I always try to do what is best for them.


# My Approach

One thing I do is approach work like a programmer.
For example, I like to use git, code, and markdown.

I also like to record things so other people can
use them in the future. For example, instead of
sending an email or taking my own notes, I try
to put them in some documentation so other people
can use them.  Continuing on this, I am an avid
documenter and note taker, and my coworkers
recognize and value it.

I am passionate about **innovation**. I'm always trying
to use the best technologies I can find, and I'm
always wanting to learn. I use ChatGPT and CoPilot
extensively in my programming, and I'm always
looking for the next thing. 

When teaching of developing curriculum or documentation,
I have a few guiding principles. One of them, Grant Sanderson
follows, which is to explain things so well that the
audience feels like they could have discovered it. And
I really like that one. Another is something Sal Khan
does really well, but I'm not sure if he states it
explicitly: make sure the audience can recreate what
you're doing. This is why it's helpful when teachers
do live coding or take the notes live. The audience can
follow along and create the same thing as you go.
I do this with my GeoGebra YouTube tutorials... I try
to make them so the audience can follow along, build
it themselves, and start to build their own
tinkering and learning nature.


# Full Time Vs Contract

All of my roles so far have been full time, and I think
I want to try contract. I'm still open to both, but contract
work seems like it might be worth a try because I like to
try new things and experience different positions.

# Industry

My instinct is that the industry matters less to me than
the role/position, but there are some industries that would
interest me. In particular, I care a lot about things such as

- education
- technology
- AI and large language models
- personal development
- clear thinking
- mental health

So, if I could work on something in one of those areas or
something related, that would be a plus for me.

# AI

One other thing to mention is that I'm very interested in AI
and large language models. I want to use them in my work,
and I am on board with how helpful they can be. I personally
use things like ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot in my work.

# Evidence of Ability

I know that I like to present and teach, and the evidence I see
shows that my students and audience think I'm effective at that.
As mentioned in the resume, my students all give me very good
ratings, and at the career fair, I made enough impact that the
students were looking for me the following year.
And I have presented at various meetups and enjoyed it and
got a lot of positive feedback from the other members in the
groups.
