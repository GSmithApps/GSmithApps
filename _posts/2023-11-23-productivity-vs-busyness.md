I've recently been introduced to the difference between
busy-ness vs productivity.  Like, you feel like you always
need to be busy, but you aren't necessarily getting anything
done or going anywhere or doing what you want. I feel
like I fall victim to that a lot. 

Another example of where I've seen this is in working
out... you can work out as hard as you want, but if
you don't do it in effective ways, you won't get
more fit.  So I'm equating busyness with working out hard,
and now that I think about it, I fall victim to that
too. I work out hard, but I don't look into any
sort of effectiveness, or what workouts or combinations
thereof work.

And I also know that any successes I have, I feel like I
can't attribute them to anything I've done, and I feel
like I'm just getting lucky and I can't attribute
any successes to anything I've done (funnily enough,
I somehow manage to attribute my failures to myself)

And where these two align is that I think part of the
reason I feel like I cant attribute anything to myself
is because I don't really plan anything or think about
what will be effective -- I simply *do*. I just
go about my life with whatever rules/constraints on
my behavior, and then just *do*.  I never plan ahead
or think or consider what would actually be effective
or gain some mileage. And I think that is precisely
what keeps me from attributing wins to myself, and
it is precisely the busy-ness vs effective idea.

And a funny extra part -- I said that I somehow seem
to attribute my failures to myself, but not anything
good? Well, I think that actually does make sense
because the rules I have learned for myself are rules
to prevent failure or pain. And so if I feel pain or failure,
then I can blame that on myself because I had a rule
in place against it.

So what I'm saying is that the only guiding
principles I have are those that prevent failure,
and none to maximize effectiveness, and this is
why I'm always trying to be busy and work
hard while also not being able to attribute any successes,
but only failures to myself.
