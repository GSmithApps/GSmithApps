I sometimes find myself thinking that
if one does the hard thing, then all the easier
things would be possible. For example, if you work
a hard programming job, then you'd also be
qualified to do all the easier ones. 

But I know this is foolish because things
aren't ordered/ranked, and things don't go
by difficulty, and hard things aren't just
a superset of easy things -- everything is
different. So just because one job is harder
than another, it doesn't mean that person
could do the other person's -- the jobs are
just different. And the people working the jobs
are different too.
