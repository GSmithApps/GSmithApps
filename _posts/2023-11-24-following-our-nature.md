I spend most of my efforts into improving or working
on things or trying to modify what I am.

But when I look at things like a cat, I know that there
are some things that are fundamentally different about
them and me. And I don't think it's only environment.
I think it's genetic. They're simply different from
how we are. And the same thing goes with people.
We all are different from each other.

And what I'm thinking is that this nature of ourselves
might be more rigid or directing than I spend my
life thinking. For example, I seem to think that if
one person can do something, why can't I? And then
I think that if I can just make the right changes
or work hard enough, I could do it. But now I think
that maybe there is some amount of innate something
that I don't have too much control over.  And
maybe this is a little freeing because I currently
feel so much pressure to be great and stuff, and if
I'm not, it's because I haven't worked hard enough
or made the right changes. But with this viewpoint,
things seem to relax a little, and the fact that
I'm not something great doesn't seem as much like
my fault, but simply a fact.

So what I think we can do is start with self-awareness
and roll with our natural abilities and tendencies.
For example, I feel like a teacher at heart, and I
probably always have. So, instead of trying to push
myself away from it because it's "the easy thing" or
it isn't a way to grow as much because it isn't as
hard for me, maybe I can lean into those things
and really flourish.

It's weird in that last paragraph... for some reason
I seem to try to do things that are hard for me,
that I don't like, or don't come naturally to me. 
And maybe it makes me grow, but I think it stresses
me out, and it's hard to grow when stressed. So I think
maybe I could lean into it more.
