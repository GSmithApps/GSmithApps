Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Grant, welcome to my GitHub!

My current projects are 
the CSV Aligner VSCode extension ðŸ‘‡,
Getting into NixOS ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡, and a course called
Zero to Quarto, which shows scientific
and research groups how to shift some
of their workflows to code ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡.

# [CSV Aligner](https://github.com/GSmithApps/csv-aligner)

This is a VSCode extension that uses the inlay hints to
render csvs as columns.

# NixOS ([Home Manager](https://github.com/GSmithApps/home-manager-config)), ([All Configs](https://github.com/GSmithApps/configs))

I've recently been getting into
the nix ecosystem. Here's
a YouTube video in which I show how to start NixOS
in a virtual machine.

And [here](https://github.com/GSmithApps/home-manager-config) are my home manager configs.

# Zero to Quarto ([site](https://github.com/GSmithApps/zero-to-quarto-site)), ([slides](https://github.com/GSmithApps/zero-to-quarto))

This is the beginning stage of a course that teaches
researchers, engineers, and scientists how to use
code and publishing tools to share their work.  Specifically,
it will take them from not much experience all the way
to using Quarto.

My resume site is [here](https://github.com/GSmithApps/home-manager-config),
but it's a little boring and unmaintained.
