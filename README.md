Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Grant, welcome to my GitHub!

My current projects are 
the CSV Aligner VSCode extension ðŸ‘‡ and
NixOS ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

# CSV Aligner

This is a VSCode extension that uses the inlay hints to
render csvs as columns.

# NixOS

I've recently been getting into
the nix ecosystem. Here's
a YouTube video in which I show how to start NixOS
in a virtual machine.

And [here](https://github.com/GSmithApps/home-manager-config) are my home manager configs.

My resume site is [here](https://github.com/GSmithApps/home-manager-config),
but it's a little boring and unmaintained.
